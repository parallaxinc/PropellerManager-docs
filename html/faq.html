<div class="textblock"><h3>Why doesn't <a class="el" href="class_propeller_manager.html" title="The PropellerManager class provides an abstraction layer between PropellerSession and PropellerDevice...">PropellerManager</a> doesn't work with _____ board?</h3>
<p>If you have difficulty getting your board to work with <a class="el" href="class_propeller_manager.html" title="The PropellerManager class provides an abstraction layer between PropellerSession and PropellerDevice...">PropellerManager</a>, there are a few things to try.</p>
<p>First, upgrade to the latest version of <a class="el" href="class_propeller_manager.html" title="The PropellerManager class provides an abstraction layer between PropellerSession and PropellerDevice...">PropellerManager</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a Saleae logic analyzer, and it's at all possible, collecting the output of the analyzer on pins 31, 30, and RESn while attempting a download are important to getting this to work. Also helpful would be a schematic of the board.</p>
<p>Verify that the board uses an FTDI chip and DTR for reset (a rare crop of boards use RST or miscellaneous USB chips for some reason). If you are on Linux, you can find out pretty quickly what serial device it is by running 'dmesg -w' and then reattaching the Chameleon. You'll see something like this, which I'd like you to send me. </p><pre class="fragment">[10448.650872] usb 2-1.4.4: new full-speed USB device number 7 using ehci-pci

</pre><p>If you really want to explore this, you can download and build <a class="el" href="class_propeller_manager.html" title="The PropellerManager class provides an abstraction layer between PropellerSession and PropellerDevice...">PropellerManager</a> yourself. Building it is easy: install Qt, then: </p><pre class="fragment">$ qmake
$ make -j
</pre><p>A command-line app will be built at: </p><pre class="fragment">bin/propman
</pre><p>Use this to test whether your changes work.</p>
<p>Investigate the <a class="el" href="class_propeller_device.html#abdd17cfb7684e8b59e7aec2a9d2aac12">PropellerDevice::reset()</a> function found in src/device/propellerdevice.cpp. The reset pulse is very quick, then an 80ms wait. You can hold the reset longer by adding QThread::msleep(milliseconds) between where setDataTerminalReady is set and unset.</p>
<p>If you can tweak the values and find something that works, send a pull request with your changes and we will review them. </p>
